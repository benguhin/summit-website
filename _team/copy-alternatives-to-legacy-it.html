title: Launching Alternatives to Legacy IT
permalink: awards/2019/alternatives-to-legacy-it-2
organization: University of Texas at Austin
teamname: School of Information

problem: Our asset management was an intractable legacy system that was expensive to upgrade and miserable to use. Technicians had to use expensive hardware for field work since it required access to the on-prem network. How might we replace a complicated-to-use vendor solution for work order management.
solution: This work introduces the first publicly-available image captioning dataset for images originating from people who are blind or have low vision, an AI-based interactive assistant to improve the dataset, and interviews with end users to understand how to improve the dataset and functionality over time.
sustainable: We are using an iterative approach and an extensible, device-agnostic platform. This means the solution can evolve along with user needs and hardware.
advice: Account for not just implementation of the application. Account for the data migration of systems as well.
